# AlienWorldsBot

Simple script that pushes buttons on alienworlds, just for experimental use.
It use while loops to keep searching until the appropriate buttons to appear
with pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen(). That accounts for variable delays and loading times.

Obviously, it is lost if captchas or errors appear.
